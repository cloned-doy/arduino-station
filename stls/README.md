## Open sourced STL design
We chose to utilize existing open sourced designs for the wind direction, wind speed sensor, and the enclosure. 

By borrowing these designs from others, we were able to focus our efforts on the hardware design and firmware improvements.

Thanks to Mr. Nerdyde for [the wind sensors](https://github.com/Nerdiyde/Anemosens)  design.
Thanks to Debasish Dutta for [the enclosure](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2282869) design.
